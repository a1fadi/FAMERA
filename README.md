TLDR: Fam Era is a facial recognition surveillance system accessible through a website

Fam-Era is a facial recognition security surveillance system that aims to notify people in real-time of strangers entering their properties. Fam-Era cameras act as CCTV cameras; however, they can recognize faces and their movements, notifying owners should an unknown person enter their property. Through personalization, Fam-Era users can upload their photos of people that they would like their system to recognize using a custom-built database. Users are then able to use the Fam-Era website along with their login to access their set camera from anywhere in the world. Should they not be viewing their camera but a stranger enters their property, Fam-Era will notify owners that an unknown person has entered their property through text message to prompt them to start viewing their Fam-Era device.
